# Data-Cleaning-with-SQL

This project focuses on the critical process of data cleaning using SQL, where various techniques are applied to identify and rectify data quality issues. By leveraging SQL's powerful querying capabilities, we aim to transform messy, incomplete datasets into clean, structured data that can be effectively used for analysis, ensuring that the insights derived are both accurate and actionable.
